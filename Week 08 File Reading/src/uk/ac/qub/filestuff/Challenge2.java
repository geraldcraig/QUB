		 * A program is required to process the data relating to students who sat an exam, some of whom did that exam at home, and identify a sample of them to request that they submit a follow up video recording.

Write a program which will read a preformatted csv file containing the class list (who submitted) and an indicator of who was in lab (therefore don't have a video)  / did an email submission after the official end time (thus volunteering their video). 
Exclude in lab people - they have no video available
Identify 2 types of other people from the overall list: 
1. email submission people - those volunteering their video
2. a specified target number randomly selected from the remainder of people


Write out a list so it can be referred to later and the candidates can be contacted to send their video

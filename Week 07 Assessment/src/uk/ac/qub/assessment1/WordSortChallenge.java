		     // Hint:
		     // 1. Count the number of words in the String variable name 
		     // (safe to assume name will only contain letters and spaces and will always start and end with letters)
		     // 2. Arrays are easy to sort
		     // Note: There is a function of the String class called .split() which would make this very easy. 
		     // As a real challenge, see if you can do it without using this function and perhaps building your own 
		     // version of it which takes a String and divides it into an array of words.
